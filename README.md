## SEO

### How it works end-to-end

Every page on this site goes through `BaseLayout.astro`, which injects all SEO metadata into `<head>` automatically. You never write meta tags by hand in individual pages — you just pass `title`, `description`, and optionally `image` as props.

```astro
<!-- Any page: -->
<BaseLayout
  title="Experience"
  description="My work history as a Software Engineer."
>
  <!-- page content -->
</BaseLayout>
```

That single prop-pass produces all of the following in `<head>`:

```html
<title>Experience | Zunain Ali Azam</title>
<meta name="description" content="My work history as a Software Engineer." />
<link rel="canonical" href="https://muhammadamas.dev/experience" />

<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://muhammadamas.dev/experience" />
<meta property="og:title" content="Experience | Zunain Ali Azam" />
<meta property="og:description" content="My work history as a Software Engineer." />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://muhammadamas.dev/og-image.png" />
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Zunain Ali Azam" />

<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Experience | Zunain Ali Azam" />
<meta name="twitter:description" content="My work history as a Software Engineer." />
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://zunainaliazam.vercel.app/og-image.png" />
```

### SEO layer by layer

**1. Title tag**
The title is constructed in `BaseLayout.astro`:
- Homepage (`title === 'Zunain Ali Azam'`) → `Zunain Ali Azam`
- All other pages → `{Page Title} | Zunain Ali Azam`

This ensures every page has a unique, descriptive title with consistent branding.

**2. Meta description**
Each page passes its own `description` prop. There is a default fallback (`"Zunain Ali Azam — Software Engineer specializing in React, Angular, Next.js, and TypeScript."`) for pages that omit it, but every meaningful page should supply its own.

**3. Canonical URL**
Generated dynamically from `Astro.site` + the current page path:
```ts
const canonicalURL = new URL(Astro.url.pathname, Astro.site);
// → https://zunainaliazam.vercel.app/experience
```
This prevents duplicate-content penalties if the site is ever mirrored or accessed via multiple domains.

**4. Open Graph (social sharing)**
Controls how links appear when shared on LinkedIn, Facebook, Slack, Discord, etc. The `image` prop (defaults to `/og-image.png`) is the preview thumbnail. Blog posts pass `type="article"` via `BlogLayout.astro` for richer article previews.

**5. Twitter Card**
Uses `summary_large_image` — produces a large image card when a URL is shared on X/Twitter. Same title, description, and image as Open Graph.

**6. Sitemap**
`@astrojs/sitemap` automatically generates `sitemap-index.xml` at build time, listing every public page and content collection entry. Astro discovers pages by crawling the `pages/` directory and content collections. `robots.txt` points crawlers to the sitemap:

```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://zunainaliazam.vercel.app/sitemap-index.xml
```

**7. Blog posts and projects (content collections)**
`BlogLayout.astro` extends `BaseLayout` and sets `type="article"`, which signals to social platforms and search engines that the page is a long-form article. The `date` frontmatter field is rendered as a `<time datetime="...">` element, which search engines use for freshness signals.

### What to keep in mind when adding pages

- Always pass a unique, specific `description` prop (120–160 characters) — this is what appears as the snippet in Google results.
- Provide a custom `image` prop for blog posts and project pages — custom OG images dramatically increase click-through rate from social shares.
- The `sent.astro` and `404.astro` pages are intentionally excluded from the sitemap by Astro (they aren't linked content) — no action needed.
- Page titles are automatically de-duped: only the homepage renders without the `| Zunain Ali Azam` suffix.

## Deployment

The site is a static build (`pnpm build` → `dist/`). Deploy the `dist/` folder to any static host (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, etc.). Make sure the host serves the site at `https://zunainaliazam.vercel.app` so canonical URLs and the sitemap resolve correctly.
